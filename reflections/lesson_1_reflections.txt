commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

pros: have control over it
cons: got to make it part of your routine. have to build up judgement on its scope

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

there are often dependencies bewteen files in software

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows you what the commit change history was, diff shows diffs between versions
